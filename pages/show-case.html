    <h1>Show Case</h1>
    <p>Here you will find work that I have done so far. All these pieces have been done for school. Each artwork created started with research to learn about the topic or style of graphics. The next step of the process is always paper sketches. Those sketches get uploaded to my computer where the magic happens to create final products!</p>
